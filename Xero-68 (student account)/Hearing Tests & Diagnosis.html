  <h1>Hearing Tests & Diagnosis</h1>

  <p>Hearing tests are essential for evaluating how well a person can hear. These tests help diagnose hearing loss and determine its type and severity. A hearing specialist, such as an audiologist, typically performs these tests.</p>

  <h2>1. Initial Consultation</h2>
  <p>The process begins with a review of medical history and a discussion of any symptoms, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Difficulty understanding speech</li>
    <li>Asking others to repeat themselves</li>
    <li>Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)</li>
    <li>Sudden or gradual hearing loss</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Physical Ear Examination</h2>
  <p>The audiologist may inspect the ears using an otoscope to check for blockages, infections, or structural issues that could affect hearing.</p>

  <h2>3. Types of Hearing Tests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pure Tone Audiometry:</strong> Measures the softest sounds a person can hear at different frequencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Speech Audiometry:</strong> Tests how well someone understands speech at various volumes.</li>
    <li><strong>Tympanometry:</strong> Examines the movement of the eardrum to detect middle ear problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE):</strong> Checks the function of the inner ear (cochlea).</li>
    <li><strong>Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR):</strong> Measures how the brain responds to sounds; often used for newborns or unresponsive patients.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Diagnosis</h2>
  <p>Based on the test results, the audiologist will determine:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The type of hearing loss (conductive, sensorineural, or mixed)</li>
    <li>The severity (mild, moderate, severe, or profound)</li>
    <li>The best course of action for treatment or management</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Next Steps</h2>
  <p>Treatment options may include hearing aids, cochlear implants, medical treatment, or communication strategies. Regular follow-ups may also be recommended to monitor hearing health over time.</p>
