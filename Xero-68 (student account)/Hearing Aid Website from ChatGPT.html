        <h2>1. How Hearing Aids Work</h2>
        <p>
            Hearing aids are small electronic devices worn in or behind the ear. They help people with hearing loss hear better by amplifying sound.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Picks up sound from the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Amplifier:</strong> Increases the volume of the sound.</li>
            <li><strong>Speaker (Receiver):</strong> Sends the amplified sound into your ear.</li>
            <li><strong>Battery:</strong> Provides power to the device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Types of Hearing Disabilities</h2>
        <p>There are several types of hearing loss, each affecting the way sound is heard or processed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conductive Hearing Loss:</strong> Caused by problems in the outer or middle ear (e.g., earwax, infections).</li>
            <li><strong>Sensorineural Hearing Loss:</strong> Caused by damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve; often permanent.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Hearing Loss:</strong> A combination of conductive and sensorineural loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Auditory Processing Disorder (APD):</strong> The brain has difficulty processing sound information correctly.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Section 3: HAT Systems for School and Work -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. HAT (Hearing Assistive Technology) Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Hearing Assistive Technology (HAT) systems help people hear better in challenging environments like classrooms or meetings.
        </p>
        <p>Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FM Systems:</strong> A teacher wears a microphone that sends their voice directly to a student’s hearing aid or receiver.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrared Systems:</strong> Use light waves to transmit sound; often used in theaters or conference rooms.</li>
            <li><strong>Induction Loop Systems:</strong> Use magnetic fields to transmit sound to hearing aids with telecoil (T-coil) settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Amplifiers:</strong> Small, portable devices that pick up sound nearby and amplify it directly to the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These systems reduce background noise and help focus on the speaker’s voice, making them ideal for classrooms, offices, and group settings.
