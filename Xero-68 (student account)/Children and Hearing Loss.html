    <h1>Understanding Children and Hearing Loss</h1>
    <p>
      Hearing plays a vital role in a child’s speech, language development, learning, and socialization. Early detection and intervention are key in supporting children with hearing loss, especially at home and in school environments. This guide is for both parents and teachers to better understand hearing loss in children and how to support them.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What Is Hearing Loss in Children?</h2>
    <p>
      Hearing loss in children can be temporary or permanent and affects one or both ears. It may occur at birth (congenital) or develop later (acquired). Even mild hearing loss can impact a child’s ability to learn language and interact with others.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Common Causes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Genetic factors</li>
      <li>Ear infections (otitis media)</li>
      <li>Noise exposure</li>
      <li>Injuries or illnesses such as meningitis or measles</li>
      <li>Birth complications or premature birth</li>
      <li>Medication side effects (ototoxic drugs)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Signs of Hearing Loss in Children</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not responding to name or sounds</li>
      <li>Delayed speech or unclear speech</li>
      <li>Frequent need for repetition</li>
      <li>Difficulty following directions</li>
      <li>Turning the TV volume up very high</li>
      <li>Social withdrawal or frustration during communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Types of Hearing Loss</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conductive:</strong> Caused by problems in the outer or middle ear (e.g., ear infections).</li>
      <li><strong>Sensorineural:</strong> Due to inner ear or nerve damage, often permanent.</li>
      <li><strong>Mixed:</strong> A combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Impact on Learning and Development</h2>
    <p>
      Hearing loss can delay language development and affect literacy, academic performance, attention, and behavior. Children may struggle with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding spoken instructions</li>
      <li>Participating in group discussions</li>
      <li>Developing social relationships</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Tip for Teachers:</strong> Always face the class when speaking and use visual aids to reinforce spoken content.
    </div>

    <h2>6. Diagnosis and Early Intervention</h2>
    <p>
      Early hearing screening (ideally before 1 month old) is essential. If hearing loss is detected, intervention should begin as early as possible—preferably before 6 months of age.
    </p>
    <p>Intervention may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hearing aids or cochlear implants</li>
      <li>Speech and language therapy</li>
      <li>Family counseling and support</li>
      <li>Individualized Education Plan (IEP) in schools</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. How Parents Can Help</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourage communication through gestures, signs, and facial expressions</li>
      <li>Keep background noise low at home</li>
      <li>Read aloud to your child daily</li>
      <li>Work closely with healthcare providers and educators</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Tip for Parents:</strong> Use simple, clear speech and check for understanding. Praise communication efforts often.
    </div>

    <h2>8. How Teachers Can Support Students</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Seat the child near the front of the class</li>
      <li>Use visual instructions, captions, and written handouts</li>
      <li>Use FM systems or sound-field amplification when available</li>
      <li>Collaborate with speech-language pathologists and special educators</li>
      <li>Be patient and inclusive in group activities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Building an Inclusive Environment</h2>
    <p>
      Both schools and homes should foster understanding and acceptance of hearing loss. Encourage other children to be kind and supportive peers. Normalize the use of hearing aids, sign language, or other tools.
